# Little Lemon Website
### This is a website created for an **imaginary** Meditarrenian Restaurant called Little Lemon.
- This website was built for the Meta Frontend Developer Course.
- Includes only HTML and CSS as of the first push of the project to the github.
- The course is still yet to complete therefore further improvements are expected as of the first push.
